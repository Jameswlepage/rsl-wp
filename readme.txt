== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is RSL (Really Simple Licensing)? =

RSL is an XML-based standard for defining machine-readable licensing terms for digital content. It allows content owners to specify how their content can be used by AI systems, search engines, and other automated tools.

= Is this compatible with existing copyright notices? =

Yes! RSL complements traditional copyright notices by making them machine-readable. You can include copyright holder information in your RSL licenses.

= Can I use this with Creative Commons licenses? =

Absolutely! RSL supports standard license references. You can link to Creative Commons licenses using the standard URL field, making your CC licensing machine-readable.

= Does this work with caching plugins? =

Yes, RSL works with popular caching plugins like WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, and LiteSpeed Cache. The licensing information is embedded during page generation.

= Can I license different parts of my site differently? =

Yes! You can create multiple licenses with different URL patterns (e.g., /blog/, /images/, /api/) or override the global license on specific posts and pages.

= Will this slow down my site? =

No. RSL adds minimal overhead - just small XML snippets to your HTML and database queries are optimized. The impact on site performance is negligible.

= Do I need a license server? =

No, license servers are optional. RSL works perfectly for declaring licensing terms without external services. License servers are only needed for paid licensing, authentication, or usage tracking.

= Is this compatible with WordPress multisite? =

Yes! Each site in a multisite network can have its own RSL configuration and licenses.

= What file formats support embedded metadata? =

Currently: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, WebP (XMP metadata), PDF (companion files), and EPUB (OPF metadata). More formats planned for future releases.

= Can I export/import license configurations? =

License data is stored in your WordPress database and included in standard WordPress exports. Manual export/import features are planned for a future release.
