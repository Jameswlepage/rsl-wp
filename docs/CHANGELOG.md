## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **Single Table Storage**: Simplified schema for better performance and maintenance
- **Hook-Based Design**: Maximum compatibility with other WordPress plugins
- **XML Generation**: Pure PHP implementation without external dependencies
- **Caching Strategy**: Leverages WordPress caching with appropriate cache headers

### Future Considerations
- Content encryption support (planned for v1.1)
- Advanced license server features (payment processing, usage tracking)
- Additional media format support (video, audio metadata)
- Bulk import/export functionality
- Multi-language license support

### Known Limitations
- XMP embedding requires server-side image processing capabilities
- EPUB metadata modification requires ZIP manipulation libraries
- License server authentication is basic (token-based)
- No built-in payment processing (relies on external license servers)
