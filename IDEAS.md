# RSL Plugin Ideas & Future Architecture

## Abilities-First Architecture

**Concept**: Refactor the plugin to use WordPress Abilities as the core business logic layer, with all other interfaces (admin pages, REST endpoints, CLI) consuming abilities rather than duplicating logic.

### Current State
- Abilities are thin wrappers around existing REST endpoints
- Admin pages have their own logic (ajax handlers, form processing)
- REST endpoints have separate implementations

### Proposed Architecture
- **Abilities as Single Source of Truth**: All business logic lives in abilities
- **Schema-Driven Admin UI**: Forms generated from ability `input_schema` definitions
- **Auto-Generated REST Endpoints**: Trivial wrappers that just call `wp_execute_ability()`
- **Self-Documenting Interfaces**: Admin UI becomes automatically documented from ability descriptions

### Benefits
- Eliminates code duplication between interfaces
- Forces API-first design thinking
- Makes plugin inherently more extensible
- Provides consistent validation across all interfaces
- Admin interfaces become self-updating when abilities change

### Considerations
- Would make WordPress Abilities API a hard dependency
- Breaks from typical WordPress admin patterns (but might be beneficial)
- Requires robust form generation from JSON schemas
- Would be pioneering this approach in WordPress ecosystem

### Implementation Ideas
```php
// Admin form generation
$ability = wp_get_ability('rsl-licensing/create-license');
$form_html = RSL_Form_Generator::generate_from_schema($ability->get_input_schema());

// REST endpoints become trivial
public function rest_create_license($request) {
    return wp_execute_ability('rsl-licensing/create-license', $request->get_params());
}
```

This would make RSL a showcase for modern, abilities-first plugin architecture in WordPress.
